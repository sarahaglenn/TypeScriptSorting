# Overview

This project
- implements a simple "Hello World" type function
- defines sorting algorithms using 4 different strategies
- fetches population data
- measures the execution time of each sorting strategy to measure different data sets

The purpose in writing this project was to learn to use functions and classes in TypeScript. It was also to understand the differences between JavaScript and TypeScript so that I am proficient in elevating JavaScript to TypeScript in future projects.

# Development Environment

- Visual Studio Code
- TypeScript
- ESLint and Prettier

# Useful Websites

- [The TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)
- [Geeks for Geeks - Sorting Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithms/)

# Future Work

- Code the tests to run 20 times and then calculate and display the average execution time to give a better big picture
- Generate or fetch more differing datasets. Specifically find data with large ranges, small ranges, intentionally randomized values, or values in reverse sorted order
- Group and analyzing the execution time based on the type of data being given
- Look closer at unrealistic or unexpected results. (ex: is the data close to sorted?)
