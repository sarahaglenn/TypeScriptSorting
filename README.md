# Overview

This project:
- Implements a basic "Hello World" function
- Defines sorting algorithms using 4 different strategies
- Retrieves population data from external source
- Measures the execution time of each sorting strategy across various data sets

The goal of this project was practice using functions and classes in TypeScript, as well as to gain an understanding of the main differences between JavaScript and TypeScript. This knowledge will help me effectively transition JavaScript code to TypeScript in future projects.

# Future Work

- Code the tests to run 20 times and then calculate and display the average execution time to give a better big picture
- Generate or fetch more differing datasets. Specifically find data with large ranges, small ranges, intentionally randomized values, or values in reverse sorted order
- Group and analyzing the execution time based on the type of data being given
- Look closer at unrealistic or unexpected results. (ex: is the data close to sorted?)
